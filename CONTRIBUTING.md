Please avoid posting issues with Github - instead, please join the Slack team and the Trello board.

Once you've got a handle on how Git works (Tutorials below) go ahead and pull the code down.
Once you've got a copy of the code, make a branch off of the development branch and write your code.
If you're satisfied, create a pull request on GitHub and we'll review it, and merge it into the code base for you.
