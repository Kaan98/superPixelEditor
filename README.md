Hey there, This is a project being developed by the [r/learnProgramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) community. 
Most of us are students or new developers, and we decieded it would be a fun idea if we all got together to learn how to work in a programming team together. 
If you are interested in joining us, you can join our [slack team](https://rlearnprograming.slack.com/shared_invite/MTM5NzQwOTU5MjY5LTE0ODY2OTQ4NjYtZDE0MGU4ZTY0NA).
